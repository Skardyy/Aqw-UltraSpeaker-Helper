# Aqw-UltraSpeaker-Helper
a script to help people kill UltraSpeaker without losing their minds

# Before
make sure you have autohotkey installed so you can run the script :)
https://www.autohotkey.com/

# How
all you need is to choose which class you're using apply
and then everytime the speaker says something hit q (change it at will in the code) 
the gui will tell you if you need to taunt or zone
